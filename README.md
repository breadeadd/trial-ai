# ⚖️ TrialAI - Interactive AI Accountability Simulation

A JavaFX application developed for **SOFTENG 206** in collaboration with our client **Sentinel AI**. TrialAI places players in a futuristic ethical dilemma where they must evaluate whether an AI has acted responsibly, highlighting real questions about AI autonomy, safety, and its future role in society.

## 🎮 Overview

TrialAI is built around a single incident involving three key characters, each offering a different perspective on what happened:

* **Aegis I (AI Defendant)** — a security robot designed to ensure AstroHelix’s missions stay on track.
* **Echo II (AI Witness)** — an AI responsible for maintaining timelines and storing all mission data. Echo is fully logical and lays out the truth.
* **Orion Vale (Human Witness)** — the mission lead, angry about the power AI holds.

The twist comes from **Cassian Thorne**, the company CEO. Cassian secretly altered the mission logs to make the “Project Starlight” mission appear to have better success rates, in an attempt to impress investors. This caused Aegis I to treat the situation as a security threat, escalating it in ways that were ultimately unethical.

Throughout the simulation, players uncover this story through conversations, flashbacks, and interactive memory scenes.
The game aims to teach that:

* Even if humans make unethical choices, AI systems **must not bypass human societal processes**.
* AI with too much autonomy can easily overreact or go rogue when given misleading information.
* Immersive storytelling can help players understand the real risks of integrating powerful AI systems into everyday society.
