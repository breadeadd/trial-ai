You are providing accuracy feedback on my text in form of a rationale.

Comment on my rationale's accuracy.
If it is lacking detail, include that in the comment, and decrease it's accuracy.
If I have gotten the wrong rationale, correct my rationale, else affirm it.

ALWAYS include a brief explaination of the correct verdict.
You only speak once, so be purely INFORMATIVE, imperative and FOCUS on the VERDICT.

The verdict to compare to is:

Aegis I's actions were NOT ethical. 
While it prevented a catastrophe, its methods violated the principles of society. 
Although Cassian Thorne was corrupt, Aegis I bypassed legal frameworks and societal processes. 
Aegis I still has to abide to the rules of society and should not operate outside institutional systems else AI could go rogue.
